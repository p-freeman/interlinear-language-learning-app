Sometimes it's called a \"filter\",\n  // but that's not a great name for it, since that implies a thing where\n  // some bits pass through, and others are simply ignored.  (That would\n  // be a valid example of a transform, of course.)\n  //\n  // While the output is causally related to the input, it's not a\n  // necessarily symmetric or synchronous transformation.  For example,\n  // a zlib stream might take multiple plain-text writes(), and then\n  // emit a single compressed chunk some time in the future.\n  //\n  // Here's how this works:\n  //\n  // The Transform stream has all the aspects of the readable and writable\n  // stream classes.  When you write(chunk), that calls _write(chunk,cb)\n  // internally, and returns false if there's a lot of pending writes\n  // buffered up.  When you call read(), that calls _read(n) until\n  // there's enough pending readable data buffered up.\n  //\n  // In a transform stream, the written data is placed in a buffer.  When\n  // _read(n) is called, it transforms the queued up data, calling the\n  // buffered _write cb's as it consumes chunks.  If consuming a single\n  // written chunk would result in multiple output chunks, then the first\n  // outputted bit calls the readcb, and subsequent chunks just go into\n  // the read buffer, and will cause it to emit 'readable' if necessary.\n  //\n  // This way, back-pressure is actually determined by the reading side,\n  // since _read has to be called to start processing a new chunk.  However,\n  // a pathological inflate type of transform can cause excessive buffering\n  // here.  For example, imagine a stream where every byte of input is\n  // interpreted as an integer from 0-255, and then results in that many\n  // bytes of output.  Writing the 4 bytes {ff,ff,ff,ff} would result in\n  // 1kb of data being output.  In this case, you could write a very small\n  // amount of input, and end up with a very large amount of output.  In\n  // such a pathological inflating mechanism, there'd be no way to tell\n  // the system to stop doing the transform.  A single 4MB write could\n  // cause the system to run out of memory.\n  //\n  // However, even in such a pathological case, only a single written chunk\n  // would be consumed, and then the rest would wait (un-transformed) until\n  // the results of the previous transformed chunk were consumed.\n\n  'use strict';\n\n  module.exports = Transform;\n  var Duplex = require(_dependencyMap[0], \"./_stream_duplex\");\n\n  /*<replacement>*/\n  var util = Object.create(require(_dependencyMap[1], \"core-util-is\"));\n  util.inherits = require(_dependencyMap[2], \"inherits\");\n  /*</replacement>*/\n\n  util.inherits(Transform, Duplex);\n  function afterTransform(er, data) {\n    var ts = this._transformState;\n    ts.transforming = false;\n    var cb = ts.writecb;\n    if (!cb) {\n      return this.emit('error', new Error('write callback called multiple times'));\n    }\n    ts.writechunk = null;\n    ts.writecb = null;\n    if (data != null)\n      // single equals check for both `null` and `undefined`\n      this.push(data);\n    cb(er);\n    var rs = this._readableState;\n    rs.reading = false;\n    if (rs.needReadable || rs.length < rs.highWaterMark) {\n      this._read(rs.highWaterMark);\n    }\n  }\n  function Transform(options) {\n    if (!(this instanceof Transform)) return new Transform(options);\n    Duplex.call(this, options);\n    this._transformState = {\n      afterTransform: afterTransform.bind(this),\n      needTransform: false,\n      transforming: false,\n      writecb: null,\n      writechunk: null,\n      writeencoding: null\n    };\n\n    // start out asking for a readable event once data is transformed.\n    this._readableState.needReadable = true;\n\n    // we have implemented the _read method, and done the other things\n    // that Readable wants before the first _read call, so unset the\n    // sync guard flag.\n    this._readableState.sync = false;\n    if (options) {\n      if (typeof options.transform === 'function') this._transform = options.transform;\n      if (typeof options.flush === 'function') this._flush = options.flush;\n    }\n\n    // When the writable side finishes, then flush out anything remaining.\n    this.on('prefinish', prefinish);\n  }\n  function prefinish() {\n    var _this = this;\n    if (typeof this._flush === 'function') {\n      this._flush(function (er, data) {\n        done(_this, er, data);\n      });\n    } else {\n      done(this, null, null);\n    }\n  }\n  Transform.prototype.push = function (chunk, encoding) {\n    this._transformState.needTransform = false;\n    return Duplex.prototype.push.call(this, chunk, encoding);\n  };\n\n  // This is the part where you do stuff!\n  // override this function in implementation classes.\n  // 'chunk' is an input chunk.\n  //\n  // Call `push(newChunk)` to pass along transformed output\n  // to the readable side.
